C++ Programming Fundamentals

This repository contains the code I developed during my C++ Programming Fundamentals course. It covers a range of fundamental C++ concepts, including:

Data Types: Integers, Floats, Doubles, Characters, Booleans, etc.
Operators: Arithmetic, Relational, Logical, Bitwise operators.
Control Flow: If-else statements, Switch statements, Loops (for, while, do-while).
Functions: Function declaration, definition, parameters, return values, function overloading.
Arrays: One-dimensional and multi-dimensional arrays.
Pointers: Pointer arithmetic, dynamic memory allocation (new, delete).
Classes and Objects: Object-oriented programming concepts, encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism.
File I/O: Reading from and writing to files.
Standard Template Library (STL): Introduction to STL containers (vectors, lists, maps), algorithms, and iterators.
Project Structure:

Each folder may represent a specific topic or assignment.
Each folder may contain source code files (.cpp), header files (.h), and any necessary input/output files.
How to Use:

Clone the repository:

Bash

git clone <repository_url>
Navigate to the specific project folder:

Bash

cd <project_folder>
Compile and run the code:

Bash

g++ -o <executable_name> <source_file.cpp> 
./<executable_name>
